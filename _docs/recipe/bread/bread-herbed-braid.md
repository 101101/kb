  - 1 teaspoon dried oregano (2 teaspoons chopped fresh)  
  - 2 teaspoons dried basil (2 teaspoons chopped fresh)

  - ¼ cup olive oil  
  - 1 egg  
  - ½ cup water  
  - 2 tablespoons butter (melted and cooled)

### Instructions:  
  1. **Roasted Garlic**  
     - Preheat oven to 400ºF
     - Cut the top ¼ inch off the Garlic  
     - Place on Aluminum foil  
     - Drizzle with Olive Oil  
     - Sprinkle with Salt  
     - Wrap the foil around the head  
     - Bake for 30min
     - Remove and let cool  
  2. **Bread Preparation**  
     - Mix the Yeast with ½ cup warm water (105ºF - 115ºF) and let sit **15 min**   
     - Mix the rest of the dry/fresh ingredients in a large bowl  
     - Whisk the egg, milk, and oil in a separate dish  
     - Pour into dry mix and start to combine  
     - While the dry ingredients and milk mixture combine, slowly pour in the water  
     - The dough should be slightly tacky. It will clean the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom of the bowl. Add more flour, if needed  
     - Once dough is the correct consistency, knead for about **5 minutes** until the texture is smooth and elastic. You should be able to stretch the dough a bit without it breaking  
     - Cover the dough and let rest in the mixing bowl or on the counter for **15 minutes**  
     - Preheat oven to 375ºF  
     - Separate the dough into 3 pieces and lay them flat on a lined or greased cookie sheet  
       - Starting at the top, bring the outside strand over the middle strand, so it becomes the new middle strand  
       - Repeat with the opposite side  
       - Repeat this pattern until the whole loaf is braided  
       - Pinch and tuck under both of the ends  
     - Cover and let rest **15 more minutes**  
     - Bake on a lined or greased cookie sheet for 20-25 minutes, until the top is golden brown  
     - Remove from oven and brush top of baked bread with melted butter and let cool
